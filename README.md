Project Title: 8-Bit Roguelike Game

Author: Eric Hensley

Description: This game that I made is a roguelike with 8-bit graphics. It is be fairly fast-paced with randomly generated levels and items to collect throughout your run through. You play as a rat in the sewers and fighting monsters along the way. Each level is increasingly more difficult as the game progresses and the game ends once you reach the final room with the golden rat tail.

Features: The fighting mechanic is fairly simple, all you have to do is bump into the enemy mobs to do damage. There is also a throwing mechanic with certain items. The enemies have an AI tracking system and all of the levels are procedurally generated. There is also a healing and cursing mechanic that either does heals or does damage to the player.

Technology Used: Pico-8 Game Engine and Windows 11 Laptop

Installation / Running Instructions: The Pico-8 Engine is required for this game to function, so that needs to be bought and installed. Copy the code from the GitHub Repo in their own unique sections and the sprites from the screenshots provided in the screenshot section of this folder. There is another way but it is much more complicated as it requires a decent amount of knowledge it Pico-8 from the actual player.

Known Issues / Limitations: Since the engine is in 8-bit, the game cant run large operations at once. Sometimes, the enemies are too challenging for the player initially.

Future Improvements: In the future, I can add more balanced items in comparison to the difficulty of the enemies.
